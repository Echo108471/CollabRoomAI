# CollabRoomAI



Modern teams live in chat, but important insights get lost in scroll-back, files get lost, and people burn time re-explaining the same info. By placing an AI “teammate” inside the room, we can turn every message, file, and thread into searchable, actionable knowledge in real time.


Goals:


- Summarize any slice of the conversation or an uploaded file on demand.
- Answer questions about the ongoing discussion or past context (memory).
- Stay present in the same stream as everyone else, with no context-switching.
